# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to deprecated APIs or nullable reference types, as these can indicate areas that may cause runtime issues.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to a currently supported version of .NET, such as `net8.0`. If it is targeting an older version like `net5.0` or `net6.0`, consider updating it:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

After changing the target framework, re-run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally to verify it runs as expected:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj --configuration Release
```

Navigate through the application and exercise its core functionality to check for any runtime exceptions or behavioral regressions.

### 5. Execute Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, run them to validate that existing functionality has not been broken during the transformation:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review the test results and investigate any failures.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in the legacy .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` namespace usages (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- `HttpContext` and related types (replaced by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http`)
- `ConfigurationManager` (replaced by `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`)
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry or certain `System.Drawing` features

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat` tooling to identify any remaining compatibility concerns.

### 7. Validate Configuration Files

Ensure that any `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.{Environment}.json` files are present and correctly structured. If the project previously used `Web.config` or `App.config`, confirm that the relevant settings have been migrated to the appropriate .NET configuration system.

### 8. Verify Static Files and Middleware

If this is a web application, confirm that static files, routing, and middleware are configured correctly in `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs`. Test key routes and endpoints manually to ensure they respond as expected.

### 9. Publish the Application

Once local validation is complete, publish the application to confirm the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to ensure all required files are present before deploying to the target environment.
