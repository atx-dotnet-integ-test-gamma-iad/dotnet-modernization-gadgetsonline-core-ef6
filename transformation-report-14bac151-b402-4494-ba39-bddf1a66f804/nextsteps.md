# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected in any of the projects within the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts and resolve them before proceeding.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Confirm that the build completes with zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and verify that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to an appropriate and currently supported version of .NET, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

If it is targeting an older or end-of-life version such as `net5.0` or `net6.0`, consider updating it to a long-term support (LTS) release.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application and verify that core functionality behaves as expected compared to the legacy version.

### 5. Execute Unit Tests

If the solution contains test projects, run all tests to validate business logic and functionality:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review test results and address any failing tests before proceeding to deployment.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` namespace usage (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- `HttpContext` and related types (replaced by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http`)
- `ConfigurationManager` (replaced by `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`)
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry or certain `System.Drawing` features

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.ApiCompat` tool to identify any remaining compatibility issues.

### 7. Verify Configuration Files

Ensure that any `web.config` or `app.config` settings have been properly migrated to `appsettings.json` or environment-based configuration. Confirm that connection strings, application settings, and any middleware configuration are functioning correctly.

### 8. Publish the Application

Once validation is complete, publish the application to confirm the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to ensure all required files, static assets, and dependencies are present.
