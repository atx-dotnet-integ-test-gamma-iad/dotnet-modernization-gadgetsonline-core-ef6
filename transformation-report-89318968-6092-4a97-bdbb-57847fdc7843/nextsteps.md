# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Verify that the build completes with zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

If the project is a web application, ensure the appropriate SDK is declared at the top of the project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
```

### 4. Check for Removed or Replaced APIs

Inspect the codebase for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have been removed or altered in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references, which are not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext`, `HttpRequest`, and `HttpResponse` usage, which should now come from `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http`
- `ConfigurationManager`, which should be replaced with `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry or certain `System.Drawing` features

### 5. Run the Application Locally

Start the application using the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate to the application in a browser and exercise the primary workflows to confirm runtime behavior is correct.

### 6. Execute Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, run them to validate that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results and address any failures before proceeding.

### 7. Review Configuration Files

Confirm that `appsettings.json` (and environment-specific variants such as `appsettings.Development.json`) contain all configuration values that were previously held in `Web.config` or `App.config`. Pay particular attention to:

- Connection strings
- Application settings keys
- Authentication or authorization configuration

### 8. Verify Static Assets and Views

If this is a web project, manually verify that static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) are being served correctly and that all views render without errors. Check that the `wwwroot` folder is structured appropriately.

### 9. Test on Target Platforms

Since the goal of the transformation is cross-platform compatibility, run and test the application on each operating system you intend to support (Windows, Linux, or macOS) to surface any platform-specific runtime issues.
