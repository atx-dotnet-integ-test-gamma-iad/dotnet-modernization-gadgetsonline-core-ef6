# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Confirm that the build output reports zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and verify that the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

If the project is a web application, confirm the appropriate SDK is declared at the top of the project file:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
```

### 4. Check for Removed or Replaced APIs

Even without build errors, some APIs that existed in .NET Framework may behave differently or have been replaced in cross-platform .NET. Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to scan for any runtime compatibility issues.

### 5. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally and verify core functionality:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application and exercise the primary workflows, such as product browsing, cart operations, and any checkout or account functionality, to confirm runtime behavior matches expectations.

### 6. Execute Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, run them to validate business logic:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results for any failures that may indicate behavioral differences introduced by the migration.

### 7. Review Static Files and Configuration

- Confirm that `appsettings.json` contains the correct configuration values and that any settings previously held in `Web.config` or `App.config` have been properly migrated.
- Verify that static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are served correctly when the application runs.
- Check that connection strings and environment-specific settings are correctly configured for the target deployment environment.

### 8. Publish the Application

Once local validation is complete, publish the application to verify the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to confirm all required files, assemblies, and assets are present before deploying to the target environment.
