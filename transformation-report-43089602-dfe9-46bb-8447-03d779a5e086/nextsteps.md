# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected across any of the projects in the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the solution root to ensure all NuGet packages are properly restored:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm the absence of errors in a clean build environment:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Address any warnings that surface during this step, particularly those related to nullable reference types, deprecated APIs, or target framework compatibility.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to a currently supported version, such as `net8.0`. If it is set to an older version like `net5.0` or `net6.0`, consider updating it:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

After changing the target framework, re-run `dotnet restore` and `dotnet build`.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application locally to verify runtime behavior:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj --configuration Release
```

Navigate through the application and exercise the primary workflows to confirm there are no runtime exceptions or missing functionality.

### 5. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains a test project, execute the test suite:

```bash
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

Review any failing tests and determine whether they are caused by behavioral differences introduced during the migration or by pre-existing issues.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the codebase for usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references (not available in cross-platform .NET)
- `HttpContext` and related types (replaced by `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http`)
- `ConfigurationManager` (replaced by `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration`)
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry or WCF server-side components

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.UpgradeAssistant` tool to identify any remaining compatibility issues.

### 7. Verify Static Assets and Configuration Files

Confirm that the following files have been correctly migrated and are present in the project:

- `appsettings.json` (replacing `Web.config` or `App.config` where applicable)
- Static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images are located under the `wwwroot` folder if this is an ASP.NET Core web project

### 8. Publish the Application

Once local validation is complete, publish the application to verify the output is correct:

```bash
dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish
```

Review the contents of the `./publish` directory to confirm all required files are present before deploying to the target environment.
