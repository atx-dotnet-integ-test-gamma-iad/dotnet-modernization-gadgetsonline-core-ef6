# Next Steps

## Issues resolved
- Transformed GadgetsOnline.csproj to net8.0

## Summary

The transformation appears to have completed successfully. No build errors were detected in any of the projects within the solution, including `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj`.

## Validation Steps

### 1. Restore Dependencies

Run the following command from the root of the solution to ensure all NuGet packages are restored correctly:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

Review the output for any warnings related to missing packages or version conflicts.

### 2. Build the Solution

Perform a full build to confirm there are no compilation issues:

```bash
dotnet build --configuration Release
```

Verify that the build completes with zero errors and review any warnings that may indicate deprecated APIs or compatibility concerns.

### 3. Review Target Framework

Open `GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj` and confirm the `<TargetFramework>` element is set to the intended cross-platform .NET version, for example:

```xml
<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
```

If the project is a web application, ensure it references `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` or the appropriate framework.

### 4. Run the Application Locally

Start the application and verify it runs as expected:

```bash
dotnet run --project GadgetsOnline/GadgetsOnline.csproj
```

Navigate through the application's core functionality to confirm behavior matches the legacy version.

### 5. Run Existing Tests

If the solution contains test projects, execute them to validate that existing functionality has not regressed:

```bash
dotnet test
```

Review the test results and address any failing tests that may indicate behavioral differences introduced during the migration.

### 6. Check for Removed or Changed APIs

Review the code for any usage of APIs that were available in .NET Framework but have changed or been removed in cross-platform .NET. Common areas to check include:

- `System.Web` references, which are not available in cross-platform .NET
- `HttpContext` and related types if this is a web project
- Windows-specific APIs such as the registry, WCF, or Windows Forms (if applicable)
- Any third-party libraries that may still target .NET Framework only

Use the [.NET Upgrade Assistant compatibility analyzer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/upgrade-assistant-overview) or the `Microsoft.DotNet.PlatformAbstractions` tooling to identify remaining compatibility issues.

### 7. Verify Configuration Files

Ensure that configuration has been properly migrated from `Web.config` or `App.config` to the appropriate `appsettings.json` format. Confirm that connection strings, application settings, and any environment-specific values are correctly represented.

### 8. Test on Target Platform

If cross-platform support is a goal, run and test the application on each intended operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) to surface any platform-specific issues that may not appear on Windows.
